# Project 3

We are creating an app that provides users information once arrived at an airport. Information will include Food, Retail, Transport, Currency. Upon arrival (through using geo fencing) the app will determine what airport the user is standing in. This will dictate the information pushed to the application. App will consist of around 5 different views to begin and can easily be expanded. A main screen, and the 4 different sections (mentioned above). They will contain:

FOOD: A list of the different restaurants within an airport, sort-able via cuisine, general pricing, and location.
RETAIL: Same as food but for retail.
TRANSPORT: A brief description of the different modes of transport available, any customs the user may not know about (such as the safe taxi company), and maps with directions to the correct area
CURRENCY: A brief description of the local currency and comparisons between users home currency, local currency and USD using publicly available exchange rates. (does not account for local exchange rate, use for a guide). Will also has a list of the available currency exchanges and their location within the airport.
The purpose of this app is to try and alleviate the pressures of "travelling to a new places" on users. Target customer is your typical tourist/traveller. Business model is a subscription.

Extendable features include:

A checklist of all airport in the world that automatically updates
Inclusions of a "Local Customs" screen that provided tips and ticks of the local traditions/customs user is in
Inclusion of a "Security screen" that provides a list of the different laws with difference between the country of origin/country of location
Inclusion of a country screen, that provides general information on the country
Inclusion of a tourism screen, that provides general information on tourist attractions & tips
